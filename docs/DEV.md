# Developer Guide

This guide covers building the firmware from source and advanced configuration options.

## Software Requirements

- ESP-IDF v6.0 or later
- Python 3.7+ (for build tools)
- npm, vite (note: this excludes use under Wayland)
- ESP Component Manager (comes with ESP-IDF)

## Building from Source

### 1. Set up ESP-IDF

```bash
# Source the ESP-IDF environment
cd <path to esp-idf>
. ./export.sh
```

### 2. Build the Project

We provide a `build.py` helper script that handles configuration and building for different boards.

```bash
cd <path to photoframe-api>

# install npm dependencies
cd webapp
npm install
cd ..

# Build for Waveshare PhotoPainter (7.3" 7-color e-paper)
./build.py --board waveshare_photopainter_73

# Build for Seeed Studio XIAO EE02 (13.3" e-paper)
./build.py --board seeedstudio_xiao_ee02

# Build for Seeed Studio XIAO EE03 (10.3" 16-level grayscale e-paper)
./build.py --board seeedstudio_xiao_ee03

# Build for Seeed Studio XIAO EE04 (7.3" 6-color e-paper)
./build.py --board seeedstudio_xiao_ee04

# Build for Seeed Studio reTerminal E1002 (7.3" 6-color e-paper)
./build.py --board seeedstudio_reterminal_e1002

# Build for Seeed Studio reTerminal E1004 (13.3" 6-color e-paper)
./build.py --board seeedstudio_reterminal_e1004

# Clean build (optional)
./build.py --board waveshare_photopainter_73 --fullclean
```

The script automatically:
1. Builds the frontend webapp (`webapp/`)
2. Sets the correct `sdkconfig.defaults` for the selected board
3. Runs `idf.py build` OR `idf.py build` with correct options

### 3. Flash and Monitor

The project uses ESP Component Manager to automatically download the `esp_jpeg` component during the first build.

```bash
# Flash to device (replace PORT with your serial port, e.g., /dev/cu.usbserial-*)
idf.py -p PORT flash

# Monitor output
idf.py -p PORT monitor

# Flash and monitor in one go
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

**Note:** On the first build, ESP-IDF will automatically download the `esp_jpeg` component from the component registry. This requires an internet connection.

## Configuration Options

Edit `main/config.h` to customize firmware behavior:

```c
#define AUTO_SLEEP_TIMEOUT_SEC      120          // Auto-sleep timeout (2 minutes)
#define DEFAULT_ROTATE_CRON         "0 */12 *"       // Default rotation schedule (every 12h)
#define DISPLAY_WIDTH               800           // E-paper width
#define DISPLAY_HEIGHT              480    // E-paper height
```

### Key Configuration Parameters

- **AUTO_SLEEP_TIMEOUT_SEC**: Time in seconds before the device enters deep sleep when idle
- **DEFAULT_ROTATE_CRON**: Default rotation schedule (cron) for fresh devices, configurable via the web interface
- **DISPLAY_WIDTH/HEIGHT**: E-paper display dimensions (800×480 for landscape)

## Development Workflow

### Serial Monitor

Monitor device logs in real-time:

```bash
idf.py -p PORT monitor
```

Press `Ctrl+]` to exit the monitor.

### Erase Flash

To completely reset the device (including WiFi credentials):

```bash
idf.py erase-flash
```

### Finding Serial Port

**macOS:**
```bash
ls /dev/cu.*
```

**Linux:**
```bash
ls /dev/ttyUSB*
```

**Windows:**
Check Device Manager for COM ports.

## Debugging

### Enable Verbose Logging

In `idf.py menuconfig`:
1. Navigate to `Component config` → `Log output`
2. Set default log level to `Debug` or `Verbose`

### Common Issues

**Build fails with component errors:**
- Ensure ESP Component Manager is up to date
- Delete `managed_components/` and rebuild

**Flash fails:**
- Check USB cable connection
- Try a different USB port
- Reduce baud rate: `idf.py -p PORT -b 115200 flash`

**Device not responding:**
- Press and hold BOOT button while connecting USB
- Try erasing flash: `idf.py erase-flash`

## Verify Wi-Fi shutdown before scheduled refresh

Timer and ROTATE-button wakes can stop Wi-Fi after downloading the image,
thumbnail, and remote settings. The log `WiFi off before image processing and
refresh` marks successful driver shutdown. HA-configured wakes and responses
with `X-Post-Rotate-Wait-Sec` keep the connection for notifications/config sync.
An OTA check gets up to 30 seconds to finish its network and storage cleanup;
if it is still active, Wi-Fi stays on for that rotation. Interactive rotations
keep Wi-Fi on. The hourly task timer and background rotation timer are disabled for the
scheduled wake path.

Before release, build for EE02 and an SD-card board and check on battery power:

- With HA disabled and no post-rotate window, serve JPEG/PNG and BMP/EPDGZ,
  including a thumbnail and remote settings. Verify download/settings logs
  precede radio shutdown, followed by decode/refresh and normal deep sleep.
- Repeat with HTTP 304, a failed fetch/local fallback, and local-only rotation.
  Check the existing image/fallback behavior and absence of reconnect attempts
  after intentional stop. Local-only wakes must work without Wi-Fi initialization.
- Enable HA, request a post-rotate window, and enable HA through remote settings.
  Verify the connection is retained and existing notifications/config access work.
- Force the periodic OTA check due, both with a normal response and a stalled
  release endpoint. Check worker completion before shutdown, or the keep-Wi-Fi-on
  log after the 30-second wait. Inject task-allocation failure to verify there is
  no phantom active worker. Do not interrupt the check's HTTP/NVS cleanup.
- Verify provisioning and interactive BOOT/web rotations, then explicitly connect
  again after `wifi_manager_stop()` in a test build and verify normal reconnects.

Compare battery-connector current with the same upstream build/configuration.
Confirm the radio is off during decode and panel BUSY; integrate charge per wake
before claiming a battery-life improvement. Host tests cover Wi-Fi events and
shutdown policy; they do not establish hardware timing or energy savings.
